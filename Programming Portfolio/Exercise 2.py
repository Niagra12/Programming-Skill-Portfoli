Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks
"""
num1 = 8
num2: int = 10

#Need to declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
sum_of_num = num1 + num2

#Then print the value of the sum to the console.
print(sum_of_num)

"""
In this exercise, I just declared 3 variables which are (num1, num2, and sum_of_num).
num1 and num2 are needed to be integers to activate the "sum_of_num" variable which is to identify the num.
Lastly, I just needed to print the "sum_of_num".
